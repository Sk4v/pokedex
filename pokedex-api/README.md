# Pokedex Project

## 1. Introduction and Goals

The Pokedex project is an API designed to retrieve and display information about Pokémon, including their descriptions, habitats, and other relevant details. It also integrates with external translation services to offer Pokémon descriptions in different languages, such as Yoda and Shakespeare styles, based on specific conditions.

### Key Goals:
- Retrieve detailed information about Pokémon, including descriptions, from **PokeAPI**.
- Translate Pokémon descriptions using **Funtranslations API**.
- Apply specific translation logic: Pokémon from the "Cave" habitat or legendary Pokémon will have their descriptions translated into Yoda style, while others will be translated into Shakespearean English.
- Provide a clean, RESTful API for users to interact with the Pokedex data.

## 2. Context and Scope

The Pokedex is a backend system built with **Java 17** and **Spring 3**. It interacts with two external APIs:
- **PokeAPI** to fetch detailed data about Pokémon.
- **Funtranslations API** to handle translation requests (Yoda and Shakespeare styles).

The system will expose a set of RESTful endpoints to retrieve Pokémon information, with support for translation as required. Additionally, the project demonstrates how to handle asynchronous calls to external services using `CompletableFuture` in Java.

## 3. Solution Strategy

### 3.1 Architecture Overview

- **PokemonService**: Interacts with the PokeAPI to fetch Pokémon data.
- **TranslationService**: Handles communication with Funtranslations API to translate Pokémon descriptions.
- **PokemonController**: Exposes RESTful endpoints for users to query Pokémon data and get translated descriptions.

### 3.2 Key Components

1. **PokemonService**: This service is responsible for fetching Pokémon data from PokeAPI.
2. **TranslationService**: Communicates with the Funtranslations API to provide translations based on the habitat or legendary status of a Pokémon.
3. **PokemonController**: Handles incoming HTTP requests and coordinates calls to the services.

### 3.3 Technology Stack
- **Java 17**: The backend language for the project.
- **Spring 3**: The framework used for building the REST API.
  
## 4. Architecture Decisions

- **Async Handling**: We use `CompletableFuture` to handle asynchronous calls to external APIs, allowing non-blocking I/O operations.
- **Separation of Concerns**: The Pokémon-related logic is isolated in the `PokemonService`, while the translation logic is managed by the `TranslationService`.

## 5. System Requirements

- **Java 17** (JDK)
- **Maven** (for dependency management)
- **Docker** (for running external services locally, such as the Funtranslations API mock)

## 6. External Interfaces

### 6.1 PokeAPI

- **Base URL**: `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/`
- **Endpoint**: `/pokemon-species/{pokemonName}` to retrieve Pokémon species information.

### 6.2 Funtranslations API

- **Base URL**: `https://funtranslations.com/api/`
- **Endpoints**:
  - `/yoda` for Yoda translation.
  - `/shakespeare` for Shakespeare translation.

### 6.3 API Endpoints

- **GET /pokemon/{name}**
  - Retrieves the basic Pokémon information (name, description, habitat, legendary status).
  
- **GET /pokemon/translated/{name}**
  - Retrieves the Pokémon information and the translated description (either Yoda or Shakespeare).

## 9. Quality Requirements

### 9.1 Performance

- The API should be able to handle requests with minimal delay by using asynchronous calls to external services.

### 9.2 Security

- Secure all endpoints with basic authentication or OAuth, depending on the use case.
- Validate all user inputs to avoid malicious data entering the system.

### 9.3 Reliability

- Ensure the system has graceful error handling and fallback strategies if either external service is down.
- Include logging and monitoring to detect failures quickly.

## 10. Deployment

### 10.1 Local Setup

To run the application locally:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `mvn clean install` to build the project.
3. Start the Spring Boot application with `mvn spring-boot:run`.

### 10.2 Docker Setup

To run the application using Docker:

1. Build the Docker image:  
   `docker build -t pokedex .`
2. Run the application:  
   `docker run -p 8080:8080 pokedex`

## 11. Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to integrate multiple external APIs and handle asynchronous operations within a Spring Boot application. It also shows how to create a simple translation system based on Pokémon attributes, allowing users to enjoy their favorite Pokémon in various fictional languages.
